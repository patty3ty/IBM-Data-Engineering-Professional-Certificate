## Description
In this project, you will act as a data engineer hired by a solid waste management company. The company collects and recycles solid waste across major cities in the country of Brazil. The company operates hundreds of trucks of different types to collect and transport solid waste. The company would like to create a data warehouse so that it can create reports like

- total waste collected per year per city
- total waste collected per month per city
- total waste collected per quarter per city
- total waste collected per year per trucktype
- total waste collected per trucktype per city
- total waste collected per trucktype per station per city

### Objectives
- Design a Data Warehouse
- Load data into Data Warehouse
- Write aggregation queries
- Create MQTs
- Create a Dashboard

### Data
The Data Warehouse have to be designed to fit with the sample data below:\

Note that the Data Warehouse should be in snowflake schema for write-efficient.
