## Description
In this repo, I recap my solutions for the assignments for the 15-month IBM Data Engineering Professional Specialization on Coursera. The specialization contains:
- Master the most up-to-date practical skills and knowledge data engineers use in their daily roles. 
- Develop working knowledge of NoSQL & Big Data using MongoDB, Cassandra, Cloudant, Hadoop, Apache Spark, Spark SQL, Spark ML, and Spark Streaming. 
- Learn to create, design, & manage relational databases & apply database administration (DBA) concepts to RDBMSs such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, & IBM Db2. 
- Implement ETL & Data Pipelines with Bash, Airflow & Kafka; architect, populate, deploy Data Warehouses; create BI reports & interactive dashboards.​
