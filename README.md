## Description
In this repo, I recap my solutions for the assignments for the 15-month IBM Data Engineering Professional Specialization on Coursera that I have done in less than 3 weeks. The specialization contains:
- Create, design, and manage relational databases and apply database administration (DBA) concepts to RDBMSes such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM Db2. 
- Develop and execute SQL queries using SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements, database functions,  stored procedures, Nested Queries, and JOINs. 
- Demonstrate working knowledge of NoSQL & Big Data using MongoDB, Cassandra, Cloudant, Hadoop, Apache Spark, Spark SQL, Spark ML, Spark Streaming. 
- Implement ETL & Data Pipelines with Bash, Airflow & Kafka; architect, populate, deploy Data Warehouses; create BI reports & interactive dashboards.​ 

There are 13 courses throughout the specialization and a capstone project at the end:
1. Introduction to Data Engineer
2. Python for Data Science, AI & Development
3. Python Project for Data Engineer
4. Introduction to Relational Databases (RDBMS)
5. Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
6. Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting
